# FOR VEX'ed instructions, I need to turn off the normal REX prefix
# encoder.  Ideally, I could use fields names other than REX{WRXB},
# but the register lookup functions need those names.  I can get away
# with using different names for the f2/f3/66 refining legacy prefixes
# since they are only referenced by the AVX instructions.
