# Intel X86 Encoder Decoder  (Intel XED)

## Doxygen API manual and source build manual:

https://intelxed.github.io

## Bugs:

### Intel internal employee users/developers:

### Everyone else:

## Abbreviated *GITHUB* building instructions:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/intelxed/xed.git xed
git clone https://github.com/intelxed/mbuild.git mbuild
cd xed
./mfile.py
```

then get your libxed.a from the obj directory.
Add " --shared" if you want a shared object build.
Add " install" if you want the headers & libraries put in to a kit in the "kits" directory.
Add "C:/python27/python " before "./mfile.py" if on windows.

## How to build the examples:

There are two options:

1) When building libxed you can also build the examples, from the main directory (above examples):

```shell
./mfile.py examples
```

and the compiled examples will be in obj/examples.
    
2) Build a compiled "kit" and the build the examples from within the kit:

```shell
./mfile.py install
cd kits
cd <whatever the kit is called>
cd examples
./mfile.py
```
    

See source build documentation for more information.

## Binary size?

Concerned about large libraries or binaries? There are several options:
 
1. Consider building with "--limit-strings"
2. Strip the binaries
3. Consider doing an encoder-only or decoder-only build if you only need one or the other.
